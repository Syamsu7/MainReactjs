            <p>Having finished to scroll, you guys can click the picture for seeing the simple project, 
                I have been making lots of examples of the website, I have tried to create something new always
                and the result is quite fascinating, I have been makin' some portfolios which are deployed with
                GitHub, I do hope it will be usefull, I am able to recheck and develop the project as ofteh
                as possible, because the great thing in coding is building the project and sharing the imagination or even 
                helping each other for having the happinness. 
            </p>
        </div>

export default Text2;
